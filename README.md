# BlackJack

/*Blackjack, also known as 21, is one of the world’s most popular card games. The aim of the game is to get more points than the dealer,
but not more than 21 points. Once a player’s points go above 21, they lose.
The rules of the game, according to Wikipedia, are as follows:
“The player or players are dealt an initial two card hand and add the total of their cards. 
Face cards (Kings, Queens, and Jacks) are counted as ten points. 
The player and dealer can count their own Ace as 1-point or 11 points.
All other cards are counted as the numeric value shown on the card. 
After receiving their initial two cards, players have the option of getting a "hit" (taking additional cards) to bring their 
total value of cards to 21 points, or as close as possible without exceeding 21 (called "busting").
The dealer has to take hits until his cards total 17 or more points. 
If his initial two cards equal 17, the dealer does not take a hit. 
However, if his first two cards are a six and an ace (equalling 17) his hand is called a soft 17 and the dealer will then have 
to take a hit. 
Players who do not bust and have a total higher than the dealer, win. 
The dealer will lose if he or she busts, or has a lesser hand than the player who has not busted. 
If the player and dealer have the same point total, this is called a "push" and the player typically doesn't win or lose money 
on that hand.” (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack) */
